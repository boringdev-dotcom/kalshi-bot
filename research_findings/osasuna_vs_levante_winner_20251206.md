## Final Recommendation

### Council of Betting Analysis: Final Recommendation
**Match:** Osasuna vs Levante (La Liga)
**Date:** December 8, 2025

As Chairman of the Council, I have synthesized the reports from Analysts A, B, and C, along with their peer reviews. The Council has reached a strong consensus on the primary value play, focusing on market inefficiencies regarding Osasuna's offensive output.

---

### 1. Consensus Analysis
The Council agrees that this is a high-stakes "relegation six-pointer" between two flawed teams.
*   **Osasuna's Profile:** Stronger at home (10 pts) but offensively anemic (0.86 goals/game). They rely on tight margins.
*   **Levante's Profile:** The league's worst defense (1.86 conceded/game) but capable of scoring on the road (only two wins were away).
*   **Market Inefficiency:** The market is overpricing Osasuna's ability to win by a large margin. While they are favorites, their statistical profile does not support a "blowout" victory, creating a significant edge in the spread markets.
*   **Goal Expectation:** Despite Osasuna's struggles, Levante's defensive injuries and high-event style (avg 3.0 goals/match) point toward a game with goals, likely from both sides.

---

### 2. Official Council Recommendations

#### 🥇 **PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION (High Confidence)**
**Market:** Osasuna wins by over 1.5 goals?
**Ticker:** `KXLALIGASPREAD-25DEC08OSALEV-OSA1`
**Side:** **NO**
**Current Price:** 71¢ (Implies ~71% probability)
**Council Estimated Probability:** 80-84%

**Key Reasoning:**
*   **Offensive Anemia:** Osasuna scores only 0.86 goals per game. They have scored more than 2 goals in a league match extremely rarely this season.
*   **Margin Analysis:** Even when Osasuna wins at home, they typically do so by a single goal (e.g., 1-0 or 2-1).
*   **Value:** You are effectively betting that Osasuna **will NOT** win by 2 or more goals. This bet wins if: Levante wins, the match is a Draw, or Osasuna wins by exactly 1 goal. Given Osasuna's struggles to score, the market implying a 29% chance of a multi-goal blowout is a statistical error we must exploit.

#### 🥈 **SECONDARY RECOMMENDATION (Medium Confidence)**
**Market:** Total Goals > 2.5
**Ticker:** `KXLALIGATOTAL-25DEC08OSALEV-2`
**Side:** **YES**
**Current Price:** 48¢ (Implies ~48% probability)
**Council Estimated Probability:** 53-55%

**Key Reasoning:**
*   **Levante's Chaos Factor:** Levante matches average 3.0 total goals. They have the worst defense in the league (26 conceded) and are missing key defenders (Dela, Moreno).
*   **Desperation:** Both teams are in the relegation zone. A draw does little for either, encouraging attacking play in the second half.
*   **Data Support:** Combined xG and defensive lapses suggest a 2-1 scoreline is the most probable outcome, which clears this line.

#### 🥉 **TERTIARY RECOMMENDATION (Medium Confidence)**
**Market:** Both Teams To Score
**Ticker:** `KXLALIGABTTS-25DEC08OSALEV`
**Side:** **YES**
**Current Price:** 50¢ (Implies ~50% probability)
**Council Estimated Probability:** 54-56%

**Key Reasoning:**
*   **Levante Scores Away:** Despite being bottom of the table, Levante has scored in 11 of 14 matches. Their only two wins this season were away from home.
*   **Osasuna Concedes:** Osasuna concedes an average of 1.29 goals per game.
*   **Correlation:** This bet is highly correlated with the Over 2.5 recommendation. If you play both, manage your stake size accordingly.

---

### 3. "No Bet" / Avoid
**Market:** Osasuna Winner (`KXLALIGAGAME-25DEC08OSALEV-OSA`)
**Current Price:** 56¢

**Reasoning:** While Osasuna is the likely winner, the Council finds **no value** at this price. Osasuna is on a 6-game winless run in the league. Paying a premium (56¢) for a team in such poor form is mathematically unsound. The edge is found in the *margin* of victory (Primary Rec), not the victory itself.

---

### 4. Dissenting Views
*   **Analyst B** argued for betting **YES** on Osasuna -1.5 (Osasuna to win by 2+ goals), citing Levante's defensive injuries.
    *   *Council Rebuttal:* This view was rejected. It ignores the fundamental data point that Osasuna possesses one of the weakest attacks in the league. Betting on a low-scoring team to cover a handicap is a long-term losing strategy, regardless of the opponent's injuries.

---

### 5. Risk Summary
*   **The "Bore Draw" (0-0 or 1-1):** A low-scoring draw is the biggest threat to our secondary recommendations (Over 2.5 and BTTS). However, a draw **wins** our Primary Recommendation (NO on Osasuna -1.5).
*   **Osasuna Breakout:** The primary risk to our top pick is if Osasuna suddenly finds form and wins 3-0 or 4-1. While possible due to Levante's injuries, the probability is significantly lower than the 29% implied by the market.
*   **Liquidity:** The spread markets on Kalshi can have wide bid/ask spreads. **Use limit orders** to ensure you get the recommended price (or better). Do not use market orders.

# La Liga Match Analysis: Osasuna vs Levante
## 📅 December 8, 2025 | El Sadar Stadium

---

## 1. MATCH ASSESSMENT

### Situational Context
This is a **relegation six-pointer** between two teams in serious trouble. Osasuna (17th, 12 pts) hosts bottom-placed Levante (20th, 9 pts). Both teams desperately need points, creating a high-stakes, potentially cagey encounter.

### Key Statistical Insights

| Metric | Osasuna | Levante |
|--------|---------|---------|
| League Position | 17th | 20th |
| Goals/Game | 0.86 | 1.14 |
| Goals Conceded/Game | 1.29 | 1.86 |
| xG (Season) | 15.3 | 18.7 |
| xGA (Season) | 19.0 | 24.9 |
| Home/Away Form | 10 pts from 6 home | 8 pts from 8 away |

### Critical Patterns Identified

1. **Osasuna's Home Fortress**: Despite their overall struggles, Osasuna have collected **10 of their 12 points at home** (3W-1D-2L). This is where they perform.

2. **Levante's Defensive Disaster**: Conceding 26 goals in 14 matches (1.86/game) — the **worst defensive record in La Liga**. However, their xGA (24.9) suggests they've actually been slightly unlucky.

3. **Osasuna's Scoring Crisis**: Only 12 goals in 14 matches, underperforming their xG (15.3) by 3+ goals. They struggle to convert chances.

4. **Head-to-Head Dominance**: Osasuna has won 7 of 14 meetings. At home vs Levante, they've won 3-1 (2022) and 2-0 (2020) in recent meetings.

5. **Levante's Away Anomaly**: Levante's only 2 league wins came **away from home** against fellow relegation candidates (Girona 4-0, Real Oviedo 2-0).

---

## 3. BETTING RECOMMENDATIONS

### 🎯 PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: NO on Osasuna -1.5

**Ticker:** `KXLALIGASPREAD-25DEC08OSALEV-OSA1`  
**Position:** NO (Osasuna does NOT win by 2+ goals)  
**Price:** 71¢  
**Confidence:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGH

**Reasoning:**
- Osasuna scores only **0.86 goals per game** — they simply don't blow teams out
- Even in their best home performances this season, margins have been tight
- Their 5-3 Copa del Rey win was against third-tier Ebro — irrelevant to La Liga form
- Levante may be poor defensively, but they've shown they can keep games close
- H2H shows Osasuna's home wins were by margins of 2 and 1 goal
- Market implies 29% chance Osasuna wins by 2+ goals; I estimate **15-18%**

**Expected Value:** Paying 71¢ for an outcome I estimate at 82-85% probability = **+11-14% edge**

---

### 🎯 SECONDARY RECOMMENDATION: Over 2.5 Goals

**Ticker:** `KXLALIGATOTAL-25DEC08OSALEV-2`  
**Position:** YES  
**Price:** 48¢  
**Confidence:** ⭐⭐⭐ MEDIUM

**Reasoning:**
- Levante's matches average **3.0 total goals** per game (1.14 scored + 1.86 conceded)
- Levante has the worst defense in the league — they concede frequently
- Osasuna's recent home games have featured over 2.5 goals
- xG data supports higher-scoring potential: combined xG/xGA suggests 2.4-2.5 goals per team per match in this fixture
- Expert consensus points to "Goals over 2.5" as a top tip
- Relegation pressure = attacking intent from both sides

**Expected Value:** Market at 48% vs my estimate of 52-56% = **+4-8% edge**

---

### 🎯 TERTIARY RECOMMENDATION: Both Teams to Score - YES

**Ticker:** `KXLALIGABTTS-25DEC08OSALEV`  
**Position:** YES  
**Price:** 50¢  
**Confidence:** ⭐⭐⭐ MEDIUM

**Reasoning:**
- Levante WILL concede — they've kept only 2 clean sheets all season
- Levante CAN score — they average 1.14 goals/game with Eyong (6 goals) and Romero (5 goals) available
- Osasuna's defense has been leaky (18 goals conceded)
- H2H supports this: 4 of last 5 meetings saw at least one team score once
- Relegation six-pointers typically see both teams pushing forward
- Expert opinion heavily favors BTTS

**Expected Value:** Market at 50% vs my estimate of 53-57% = **+3-7% edge**

---

### 🎯 SPECULATIVE PLAY: Draw

**Ticker:** `KXLALIGAGAME-25DEC08OSALEV-TIE`  
**Position:** YES  
**Price:** 24¢  
**Confidence:** ⭐⭐ LOW-MEDIUM

**Reasoning:**
- Sports Mole specifically predicts **1-1**
- Both teams are in poor form and may neutralize each other
- Relegation pressure can create tense, cagey affairs
- Osasuna hasn't won in La Liga since early October
- At 24¢, you're getting 4:1 odds on an outcome I estimate at ~27%

**Expected Value:** Market at 24% vs my estimate of 26-28% = **+2-4% edge** (smaller edge, higher variance)

---

### ❌ AVOID: Osasuna Win at 56¢

The market is pricing Osasuna as clear favorites, but:
- They haven't won in La Liga since early October (2D-4L run)
- 56% implied probability feels 2-4% too high
- No value here — if anything, fade this if you want exposure

---

## 4. RISK FACTORS

### For NO on Osasuna -1.5:
- Osasuna's home form has been their bright spot — a psychological boost could unlock them
- Levante's defense could completely collapse (they did lose 4-0 to Girona away)
- Copa del Rey momentum (5-3 win) could carry over
- If Osasuna scores early, Levante may capitulate

### For Over 2.5 Goals:
- Osasuna's scoring woes (0.86/game) could result in a 1-0 or 0-0
- Relegation anxiety might produce a more defensive approach
- Levante may "park the bus" for a point

### For BTTS YES:
- Osasuna could shut out Levante given home advantage
- A goal-shy 1-0 or 0-1 result is plausible
- Levante's away scoring has been inconsistent

### For Draw:
- High variance play — draws are hard to predict
- Osasuna's home advantage could tip the scales
- Levante could get blown out

---

## 5. FINAL BETTING CARD

| Market | Ticker | Side | Price | Stake | Confidence |
|--------|--------|------|-------|-------|------------|
| Osasuna -1.5 | `OSA1` | **NO** | 71¢ | 2 units | HIGH |
| Over 2.5 Goals | `OSALEV-2` | **YES** | 48¢ | 1.5 units | MEDIUM |
| BTTS | `OSALEV` | **YES** | 50¢ | 1 unit | MEDIUM |
| Draw | `TIE` | **YES** | 24¢ | 0.5 units | LOW |

---

## Summary

The **highest-conviction play** is **NO on Osasuna -1.5 at 71¢**. Osasuna simply doesn't have the firepower to win by 2+ goals consistently, and this market is mispriced by 11-14%. 

The totals and BTTS markets offer moderate value given Levante's defensive vulnerabilities and both teams' desperation for goals in this relegation battle.

### gemini-3-pro-preview

Based on the detailed research provided, here is the expert betting analysis and recommendations for the Osasuna vs. Levante match on Kalshi.

### **Match Assessment**

This is a classic "Relegation Six-Pointer." While both teams are struggling near the bottom of the table, the underlying metrics heavily favor the home side, Osasuna.

*   **Home Advantage is Real:** Osasuna is a different team at home (10 points from 6 matches) compared to their away form. Levante, conversely, is the bottom-ranked team in the league.
*   **The Defensive Mismatch:** The critical factor here is Levante’s defense. They have conceded 26 goals (1.86 per game) and have a high Expected Goals Against (xGA) of ~25. To make matters worse, they are missing key defensive personnel (Dela and Moreno) due to injury.
*   **Osasuna’s Offensive Spark:** While Osasuna averages less than a goal a game in the league, their xG (15.3) suggests they are creating chances but finishing poorly. However, coming off a 5-goal haul in the Copa del Rey will have boosted their confidence significantly against a depleted Levante backline.

**Predicted Outcome:** Osasuna 2 - 1 Levante or Osasuna 3 - 1 Levante.

---

### **Betting Recommendations**

#### **1. Market: Match Winner**
*   **Ticker:** `KXLALIGAGAME-25DEC08OSALEV-OSA`
*   **Recommendation:** Bet **YES** on Osasuna.
*   **Price Analysis:** The market asks **58¢**, implying a 58% win probability.
*   **Value Analysis:** Osasuna has won 50% of their home games, while Levante has lost 64% of their total matches. When factoring in Levante's defensive injury crisis and Osasuna's dominant head-to-head record at home (won the last two home meetings), the true probability of an Osasuna win sits closer to 65%. Buying at 58¢ offers roughly 7-10% expected value.
*   **Confidence:** **High**
*   **Reasoning:** Levante has the worst defense in the league and is missing starting defenders. Osasuna relies heavily on home form to survive in La Liga and will view this as a "must-win."

#### **2. Market: Total Goals**
*   **Ticker:** `KXLALIGATOTAL-25DEC08OSALEV-2`
*   **Recommendation:** Bet **YES** on Over 2.5 goals scored.
*   **Price Analysis:** The market asks **51¢**, implying a near coin-flip (51%).
*   **Value Analysis:**
    *   Levante matches average nearly 3.0 goals per game.
    *   Levante's defense concedes nearly 2 goals per game on its own.
    *   Osasuna's recent matches and cup form indicate an uptick in attacking output.
    *   Recent H2H history at Osasuna: 3-1, 1-3, 2-0. Two of the last three cleared this line comfortably.
*   **Confidence:** **Medium-High**
*   **Reasoning:** At 51¢, the market is pricing this based on Osasuna's low average scoring record (0.86). However, it ignores the context of Levante's decimated defense. A 2-1 scoreline is highly probable, which clears this hurdle.

#### **3. Market: Spread (Handicap)**
*   **Ticker:** `KXLALIGASPREAD-25DEC08OSALEV-OSA1`
*   **Recommendation:** Bet **YES** on Osasuna wins by over 1.5 goals.
*   **Price Analysis:** The market asks **31¢** (Bid 27¢).
*   **Value Analysis:** This is a higher-risk value play. You are effectively betting on Osasuna to win by 2 or more goals (e.g., 2-0, 3-1). Given Levante has conceded 4 goals to Girona and 2 to Athletic recently, they are prone to multi-goal defeats.
*   **Confidence:** **Low (Speculative Value)**
*   **Reasoning:** If you believe Osasuna wins (Recommendation 1), the difference between a 1-goal win and a 2-goal win is often a late counter-attack goal when the losing team pushes up. Getting ~3.2 odds (implied by 31¢) on a team playing against the league's worst defense is mathematically attractive, even if Osasuna isn't a high-scoring team historically.

*Note: Avoid the `OSA2` and `LEV2` (wins by > 2.5) spread markets as the bid/ask spreads (1¢/99¢) indicate zero liquidity.*

#### **4. Market: Both Teams To Score**
*   **Ticker:** `KXLALIGABTTS-25DEC08OSALEV`
*   **Recommendation:** Bet **YES** on Both Teams To Score.
*   **Price Analysis:** The market asks **52¢**.
*   **Value Analysis:** Levante, despite being last, actually scores reasonably well (1.14 per game—better than Osasuna). They have only failed to score in one of their last few matches. Osasuna's defense concedes 1.29 per game.
*   **Confidence:** **Medium**
*   **Reasoning:** Levante is desperate and will attack; Osasuna is at home and expected to win. This dynamic usually leads to an open game. The "Sport Mole" prediction of 1-1 also aligns with this.

### grok-4.1-fast

### **La Liga: Osasuna vs Levante (Dec 8, 2025)**

#### **1. Match Assessment**
Osasuna enters as clear favorites in this relegation six-pointer, leveraging home advantage (3W-1D-2L, 10 pts from 6 home games) against Levante's dismal overall form (bottom of table, worst defense at 26 conceded in 14 games, 1.86 gpg). Osasuna's attack is anemic (0.86 gpg, underperforming 12 actual vs 15.3 xG), but their xGA (18-19) suggests defensive solidity at home, where they've won 50% of games. Levante scores decently away (1.14 gpg overall, 2 road wins vs bottom teams like Girona 4-0 and Oviedo 2-0), but injuries to key defenders (Dela, Moreno out; Espi doubtful; Martinez out) exacerbate their leaky backline (xGA 24.9-1.90 per game).

H2H favors Osasuna at home (3 wins in last 5 meetings, including 3-1 and 2-0). Recent form points to a low-to-mid scoring affair: Osasuna winless in 6 league games (2D-4L), Levante 1W-3D-7L in last 11 league. xG patterns show both underperform attack but concede freely—expect 2-2.5 total goals on average (Osasuna games ~2.14 gpg, Levante ~3.0). Likely scores: Osasuna 2-1 (25%), 1-0 (20%), 1-1 (22%), 2-0 (15%). BTTS probable (55%, given Levante's 16 goals despite poor form; Osasuna concedes 1.29 gpg). Osasuna win by 1 goal most common margin (30%); by 2+ rare (22%). Levante win or +1.5 cover likely in 45% of scenarios due to six-pointer volatility.

**My Probability Estimates**:
- Osasuna Win: 57%
- Draw: 23%
- Levante Win: 20%
- Osasuna -1.5 (win by 2+): 22%
- Osasuna -2.5: 8%
- Levante -1.5/-2.5: <5%
- Over 2.5 Goals: 51%
- Over 1.5 Goals: 76%
- Over 3.5 Goals: 27%
- BTTS Yes: 54%

#### **2. Value Analysis**
Kalshi prices reflect Osasuna favoritism (56¢ yes = 56% implied prob, aligns closely with my 57%) but undervalue edges in margins and goals:
- **Winner Market**: Osasuna yes (56¢) fairly priced (my 57% → min value at 57¢+). Levante yes (19¢) overprices their 20% chance (no value). Tie (24¢) spot-on.
- **Spreads**: Strong value on **NO Osasuna -1.5** (71¢ = 71% implied; my 78% prob → edge). Osasuna -2.5 (50¢ mid) overprices low 8% true prob. Levante spreads (1-50¢) correctly dismiss low probs.
- **Totals**: Slight value on **Over 2.5** (48¢ = 48%; my 51% → edge in high-concede matchup). Over 1.5 (74¢) fair; Over 3.5 (26¢) accurate.
- **BTTS**: **Yes** (50¢ = 50%; my 54% → modest edge, patterns show Levante scores in 70% away games vs bottom-half teams).
Market inefficiencies from thin liquidity (e.g., bid/ask spreads on spreads/totals) amplify value on conservative plays like Osasuna win and goal overs.

#### **3. Betting Recommendations**
- **Osasuna Winner YES** (Ticker: **KXLALIGAGAME-25DEC08OSALEV-OSA**)  
  Bet YES at 56¢ (bid 55¢). **Medium confidence**.  
  *Reasoning*: Home edge + H2H dominance (7-4-3 overall) vs Levante's crippled defense (4 injuries/doubts) outweighs Osasuna's winless streak. Their 50% home win rate and Levante's 0% away win rate vs mid-table yield 57% true prob (vs market 56%). Patterns: Osasuna beats bottom-5 teams at home 60% historically.

- **NO on Osasuna wins by over 1.5 goals** (Ticker: **KXLALIGASPREAD-25DEC08OSALEV-OSA1**)  
  Bet NO at 71¢ (YES bid 27¢). **High confidence**.  
  *Reasoning*: Osasuna's low scoring (0.86 gpg) limits blowouts—80% home wins by 1 goal max. Levante's road wins were high-margin but vs worse defenses; here, expect narrow 1-0/2-1 (my 78% NO prob vs 71% market). xG diff (Osasuna +xG edge ~0.3/game home) supports 1-goal margins.

- **Over 2.5 Goals YES** (Ticker: **KXLALIGATOTAL-25DEC08OSALEV-2**)  
  Bet YES at 48¢ (bid 46¢). **Medium confidence**.  
  *Reasoning*: Levante's games average 3 gpg (worst defense); Osasuna home overs 67% this season. Combined xG ~2.7/game + BTTS patterns (Levante scores 1.14 gpg away) hit 51% true prob (edge vs 48%). Analysts note 70% combined games over 2.5.

- **BTTS YES** (Ticker: **KXLALIGABTTS-25DEC08OSALEV**)  
  Bet YES at 50¢ (bid 47¢). **Low-Medium confidence**.  
  *Reasoning*: Levante's top scorers (Eyong 6gls, Romero 5gls) feature; they've scored in 11/14 games. Osasuna concedes at home (1.0 gpg); 54% true prob vs 50% market.

#### **4. Risk Factors**
- **Draw-heavy six-pointer**: 25% draw risk (e.g., 1-1 as Sports Mole predicts) kills Osasuna win and pushes under 2.5/BTTS miss.
- **Osasuna attack drought**: 6-game league winless run + 0.86 gpg could lead to 0-0/1-0 bore (hits under/BTTS NO, Osasuna -1.5 safe but winner risk).
- **Levante road punch**: 2 away wins (clean sheets) vs bottom teams; if Eyong/Romero exploit Osasuna's 18 conceded, triggers Levante upset (+1.5 cover, BTTS, over).
- **Injuries backfire**: Osasuna's Boyomo suspension risk or Levante's Espi playing could flip defensive dynamics.
- **Illiquid markets**: Wide bid/ask (e.g., spreads at 1¢-99¢) risks poor fills; monitor for shifts pre-match. Overall EV positive but volatility high in relegation scrap. Stake 1-5% bankroll per bet.

# Critical Review: Osasuna vs Levante Betting Analyses

## Individual Analyst Evaluations

---

### **ANALYST A**

**Accuracy: 8/10**
- Statistics correctly cited throughout
- Home/away form calculations accurate (Osasuna: 10 pts from 6 home = correct; Levante away: 8 pts from 8 away = correct)
- Minor issue: The xG analysis claims "combined xG/xGA suggests 2.4-2.5 goals per team per match" — this is confusingly worded and overstates the case. Combined xG for both teams is closer to 2.4 total, not per team.

**Logic: 8/10**
- Primary NO on Osasuna -1.5 is well-reasoned. Osasuna's 0.86 goals/game genuinely suggests they don't produce blowouts.
- However, estimating only 15-18% for Osasuna -1.5 feels too aggressive. The market at 29% may be slightly high, but given Levante's defensive injuries and league-worst 1.86 conceded/game, 18% might underestimate blowout potential.
- The logic connecting Copa del Rey performance (5-3 vs third-tier Ebro) as "irrelevant" is sound.

**Value Identification: 8/10**
- Correctly identifies NO on -1.5 as the strongest edge
- Over 2.5 and BTTS edges are reasonable but perhaps slightly optimistic
- Appropriately flags Osasuna Win as potentially overpriced rather than a fade

**Risk Assessment: 9/10**
- Comprehensive coverage for each recommendation
- Acknowledges psychological factors (early Osasuna goal → Levante collapse)
- Notes Copa del Rey momentum as potential spoiler

**Actionability: 9/10**
- Clear ticker symbols, prices, and stake sizing
- Confidence ratings helpful
- Final betting card is executable

---

### **ANALYST B**

**Accuracy: 7/10**
- Core statistics are correct
- Claims Osasuna win probability should be ~65% — this lacks rigorous justification and seems inflated
- Says "getting ~3.2 odds (implied by 31¢)" — actually 31¢ implies ~3.2x return, which is correct
- Analysis appears incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence at the end)

**Logic: 5/10**
- **Critical Error**: Recommends YES on Osasuna -1.5 at 31¢, directly contradicting the research that Osasuna scores only 0.86 goals/game and their H2H wins at home were by margins of 2 goals (3-1) and 1 goal (2-0). This is inconsistent reasoning.
- Claims "true probability of an Osasuna win sits closer to 65%" based on 50% home win rate and Levante's 64% loss rate — but this arithmetic doesn't cleanly produce 65%, and ignores that Levante's away form (2W-2D-4L) is actually their *better* form.
- Overweights Osasuna's Copa del Rey performance against third-tier opposition

**Value Identification: 4/10**
- Sees 7-10% edge on Osasuna win where likely none exists (market at 56%, true probability likely 52-58%)
- The YES on Osasuna -1.5 is a significant misstep — taking the wrong side of what appears to be the best value play
- Over 2.5 and BTTS recommendations are solid

**Risk Assessment: 5/10**
- Minimal risk discussion
- No acknowledgment of the risk that Osasuna's scoring drought continues
- Analysis incomplete, so full assessment impossible

**Actionability: 6/10**
- Recommendations are clear but incomplete
- Missing final summary/betting card
- One major recommendation (Osasuna -1.5 YES) is actively harmful

---

### **ANALYST C**

**Accuracy: 9/10**
- Most detailed probability breakdown
- Correctly notes Osasuna's home win rate and Levante's away form nuances
- Minor inconsistency: States "78% NO prob vs 71% market" but earlier said "my 22%" for Osasuna -1.5 (which would imply 78% NO) — math is internally consistent
- Correctly identifies illiquidity in spread markets

**Logic: 9/10**
- Most realistic on Osasuna win probability (57% vs market 56% = minimal edge) — appropriately conservative
- Agrees with Analyst A on NO Osasuna -1.5, with similar reasoning
- Provides granular score predictions (25% for 2-1, 20% for 1-0, etc.) which adds analytical rigor
- Notes that 80% of Osasuna home wins come by 1 goal max — strong supporting evidence

**Value Identification: 9/10**
- Correctly prioritizes NO on Osasuna -1.5 as highest-confidence play
- Appropriately skeptical of winner market value
- BTTS and Over 2.5 identified as secondary plays with moderate edge
- Acknowledges bid/ask spread concerns on illiquid markets

**Risk Assessment: 8/10**
- Good coverage of draw risk as spoiler for all plays
- Notes Osasuna attack drought
- Mentions Levante's road punch capability
- Could have discussed weather or lineup uncertainties more

**Actionability: 8/10**
- Clear tickers and prices
- Stake sizing guidance (1-5% bankroll)
- Confidence levels assigned
- Slightly dense presentation

## Rankings

| Rank | Analyst | Score | Justification |
|------|---------|-------|---------------|
| **1** | **C** | 8.4/10 | Most rigorous probability modeling, realistic edge assessment, correctly identifies NO on -1.5 as primary play without overreaching on winner market |
| **2** | **A** | 8.2/10 | Strong structure and clear recommendations, solid primary thesis on -1.5, slightly overstates some edges but fundamentally sound |
| **3** | **B** | 5.4/10 | Critical logical error on Osasuna -1.5 (recommends opposite side), overconfident on Osasuna win, incomplete analysis |

---

## Key Disagreements

### **1. Osasuna -1.5: The Defining Split**
| Analyst | Position | Price | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-------|-----------|
| **A** | NO | 71¢ | Osasuna can't score enough (0.86 gpg) |
| **B** | YES | 31¢ | Levante defense collapses, value at 3.2x |
| **C** | NO | 71¢ | 80% of Osasuna home wins by 1 goal max |

**Verdict**: A and C are correct. Osasuna's scoring limitations (12 goals in 14 matches, underperforming xG by 3+ goals) make 2+ goal wins structurally unlikely. Analyst B's recommendation here is a clear analytical error.

### **2. Osasuna Win Probability**
| Analyst | True Probability Estimate | Market Price | Perceived Edge |
|---------|---------------------------|--------------|----------------|
| **A** | 52-54% | 56¢ | -2 to -4% (no value/fade) |
| **B** | 65% | 58¢ | +7-10% (strong buy) |
| **C** | 57% | 56¢ | +1% (minimal value) |

**Verdict**: C is most realistic. Osasuna's winless streak in La Liga since October and Levante's decent away form (their only 2 wins came on the road) suggest the market is approximately efficient. B's 65% estimate lacks grounding.

### **3. Edge Sizing on Over 2.5 and BTTS**
All three analysts recommend these, but edge estimates vary:
- A: +4-8% on Over 2.5, +3-7% on BTTS
- B: Moderate (unspecified)
- C: +3% on Over 2.5, +4% on BTTS

These are relatively close and all defensible given Levante's 3.0 goals/game average and defensive vulnerabilities.

---

## Missing Considerations

### **1. Bet Correlation Risk**
No analyst adequately addresses that Over 2.5 YES and BTTS YES are **highly correlated** — if one hits, the other likely does too. If Osasuna wins 1-0 (plausible given their profile), both lose. Recommending both at similar stakes amplifies variance rather than diversifying.

### **2. Levante's Away Form Context**
While noted, the analysts underexplore that Levante's **only two league wins were away** (4-0 at Girona, 2-0 at Oviedo). This suggests they may actually perform better on the road when expectations are lower. This could justify slightly higher Levante/Draw probability than consensus suggests.

### **3. Tactical Setup Likelihood**
No analyst discusses how Vicente Moreno (Osasuna manager) might set up. Given their goal-scoring struggles, will they be more conservative at home in a relegation six-pointer? Or will desperation produce a more open game? Similarly, how might Levante approach this tactically?

### **4. Referee Tendencies**
No mention of which referee is assigned and their cards/fouls profile — relevant for in-game dynamics.

### **5. Weather/Pitch Conditions**
December in Pamplona can be cold and wet. Could affect goal-scoring and favor the home team.

### **6. Market Liquidity Implications**
Only Analyst C acknowledges this. The 1¢/99¢ bid-ask on some spread markets means those prices are essentially placeholder — no real market exists. Analysts A and B don't flag this adequately.

---

## Final Assessment

**Strongest Consensus Play**: **NO on

### Review by gemini-3-pro-preview

Here is the evaluation and ranking of the three betting analyses.

### 1. Evaluation of Individual Analysts

#### **Analyst A**
*   **Accuracy:** High. Correctly interprets the data, specifically noticing the disconnect between Osasuna's point total (decent home form) and their actual goal output (very low).
*   **Logic:** Excellent. The logic for the primary recommendation (NO on Osasuna -1.5) is the strongest argument in the entire dataset. They recognized that a team scoring 0.86 goals/game is statistically unlikely to cover a -1.5 handicap, even against a bad defense.
*   **Value Identification:** Strong. They utilized implied probability tables to clearly demonstrate where the edge lies. They correctly identified that the Moneyline (Osasuna Win) offered negative/no value, while the Spread market offered a significant edge.
*   **Risk Assessment:** Comprehensive. Acknowledged the specific risks of the "NO" bet (Levante defensive collapse).
*   **Actionability:** Very clear. Tickers, positions, and confidence levels are explicitly stated.

#### **Analyst B**
*   **Accuracy:** Moderate. They cite the stats correctly but draw questionable conclusions from them regarding the spread.
*   **Logic:** Flawed on the spread. They recommend betting **YES on Osasuna -1.5** (Osasuna to win by 2+ goals). While they acknowledge this is "speculative," it contradicts the fundamental data point that Osasuna has the worst attack among the non-relegation teams (0.86 goals/game). Betting on a team that barely scores 1 goal per game to win by 2+ is a fundamental logical error, regardless of the opponent's defense.
*   **Value Identification:** Mixed. They found value in the Moneyline (Osasuna Win) which Analyst A and C deemed fair/no value. Their justification (Levante's injuries) is valid, but the price (58¢) leaves little room for error.
*   **Risk Assessment:** Adequate, though they missed the risk of Osasuna's offensive impotence regarding the spread bet.
*   **Actionability:** Clear, though the spread recommendation is dangerous.

#### **Analyst C**
*   **Accuracy:** High. Deep dive into xG and probability distributions.
*   **Logic:** Sound. They align with Analyst A on the spread (NO on -1.5), correctly identifying that Osasuna wins are likely narrow (1-0, 2-1).
*   **Value Identification:** Moderate. They recommend betting the Osasuna Moneyline at 56¢ based on a 57% probability estimate. Betting into a 1% edge is generally poor advice for a junior analyst due to variance and fees; it suggests a lack of understanding of "margin of safety."
*   **Risk Assessment:** Strong. Good breakdown of specific scoreline risks (e.g., the 1-1 draw).
*   **Actionability:** Formatting is dense and difficult to read compared to A and B, but the specific tickers are there.

---

### 2. Rankings & Justification

**1. Analyst A (Best)**
Analyst A provided the most sophisticated analysis by looking at *how* Osasuna wins, not just *if* they win. They correctly identified that the market was overpricing Osasuna's ability to blow out an opponent. Their use of implied probability tables vs. estimated probability is a gold standard for presentation. They avoided the trap of betting the Moneyline at fair value and found a derivative market (Spread) with a much higher edge.

**2. Analyst C**
Analyst C reaches the correct conclusion on the Spread (NO on -1.5) and provides deep statistical backing. However, they are ranked lower than A because:
1.  **Formatting:** The dense paragraphs make it hard to extract key info quickly.
2.  **Thin Value:** Recommending a bet with a 1% edge (Osasuna Winner) is bad practice.
3.  **Liquidity:** They correctly noted liquidity issues but still recommended a Moneyline bet that is efficiently priced.

**3. Analyst B**
Analyst B is ranked last primarily due to the **Spread Recommendation**. Recommending a bet on Osasuna to win by 2+ goals (Spread -1.5 YES) ignores the most glaring statistic in the research: Osasuna scores 0.86 goals per game. While they identified the "Over 2.5" value correctly, their read on the handicap market suggests a misunderstanding of Osasuna's playstyle.

---

### 3. Key Disagreements

*   **The Spread (-1.5 Goals):** This is the major point of contention.
    *   **Analyst A & C:** Recommend **NO** (Osasuna does not win by 2+). They argue Osasuna lacks the firepower.
    *   **Analyst B:** Recommends **YES** (Osasuna wins by 2+). They argue Levante's defense is so bad that Osasuna will score multiple goals.
    *   *Verdict:* A & C are correct. In a match between a weak attack and a weak defense, betting on the weak attack to cover a multi-goal spread is statistically lower EV than fading them.
*   **The Moneyline (Osasuna Win):**
    *   **Analyst A:** Avoid (Price is too high/Fair).
    *   **Analyst B & C:** Bet YES.
    *   *Verdict:* A is likely correct to pass. At 56¢-58¢, you are paying a premium for a team that hasn't won a league match in two months.

---

### 4. Missing Considerations

*   **Copa del Rey Fatigue vs. Momentum:** All analysts noted the Copa del Rey scores, but none deeply analyzed the *fatigue* factor. Osasuna played on Dec 2, Levante on Dec 3. Levante has one less day of rest, which is significant for a team with a depleted squad (injuries) traveling away from home. This supports the Osasuna side slightly more than mentioned.
*   **Game State Dynamics:** If Osasuna goes up 1-0, they are a low-scoring team that tends to protect leads rather than chase a second goal. This reinforces the "NO on -1.5" bet, which Analyst A touched on but could have emphasized as a tactical tendency.
*   **Market Liquidity on Spreads:** Analyst C briefly mentioned bid/ask spreads. On Kalshi, spread markets often have wide gaps (e.g., 1¢ bid / 99¢ ask). Analyst A and C assumed they could get filled at the "Last Price" or mid-market. In reality, executing the "NO on -1.5" might be difficult if liquidity is low. A senior review should flag that the *theoretical* value might not be *executable*.

### Review by grok-4.1-fast

### Evaluation of Analyses

#### **Analyst A**
1. **Accuracy**: Excellent. Correctly interprets all key data points (e.g., Osasuna's home points haul, Levante's away wins vs. bottom teams, xG underperformance, H2H specifics, injury lists). No misreads.
2. **Logic**: Strong and data-driven. Ties low Osasuna scoring (0.86 gpg) directly to NO on -1.5; balances Levante's defense woes with their away resilience. Probability estimates (Osasuna win 52-54%) are conservative given form, avoiding overconfidence.
3. **Value Identification**: Best in group. Precise edge calculations (e.g., +11-14% on NO -1.5 via 82-85% true prob vs. 71% implied). Correctly flags no value on Osasuna win and prioritizes highest-edge play.
4. **Risk Assessment**: Thorough and bet-specific (e.g., Copa momentum irrelevance, Levante capitulation risk). Balanced without downplaying upsides.
5. **Actionability**: Outstanding. Full tickers, stakes, confidence ratings, summary table, and explicit avoids.

**Overall**: Comprehensive, nuanced, high-quality. Minor nit: Slight overemphasis on H2H margins without quantifying recency weight.

#### **Analyst B**
1. **Accuracy**: Good but selective. Correct on home/away splits, injuries, and Levante averages, but glosses Osasuna's league winless run (6 games) and low gpg; overplays Copa 5-3 as "confidence boost" without noting opponent quality.
2. **Logic**: Mixed. Sound on defensive mismatch, but overconfident on Osasuna win (65% estimate ignores poor form/xG underperformance) and -1.5 YES (speculative despite 0.86 gpg). H2H cited selectively (ignores Levante's 2020 home win over Osasuna).
3. **Value Identification**: Fair but optimistic. Osasuna win edge (7-10%) plausible but stretched; Over 2.5 solid; -1.5 YES value ignores Osasuna's tight home margins. Notes illiquidity well.
4. **Risk Assessment**: Weak. Risks implied in recs (e.g., late goals for margins) but no dedicated section or balanced counters (e.g., no mention of Osasuna drought leading to under).
5. **Actionability**: Clear tickers/prices/confidence, but incomplete (no stakes, no draw/BTTS full integration, abrupt end).

**Overall**: Solid structure but undermined by pushing low-scoring Osasuna for win/-1.5 YES; feels bullish without enough caveats.

#### **Analyst C**
1. **Accuracy**: Very good. Nails probs from data (e.g., 78% NO -1.5 aligns with low gpg/H2H); correctly notes Levante away scoring vs. bottom teams and injury depth.
2. **Logic**: Sound. Conservative on margins (22% Osasuna -1.5 YES realistic); good xG/avg goals synthesis. Slight overreach claiming "70% combined games over 2.5" (data implies ~60-65% based on avgs).
3. **Value Identification**: Strong. Spots NO -1.5 edge clearly; correctly deems Osasuna win "fair" (avoids forcing value). Modest edges quantified well.
4. **Risk Assessment**: Good consolidated section covers volatility (draws, droughts, upsets), illiquidity, and stakes advice.
5. **Actionability**: Clear with tickers/bids/confidence, but no stakes table or summary card; probs section enhances usability.

**Overall**: Balanced and probabilistic, but less structured than A; includes "fair" Osasuna win rec despite minimal edge.

### Rankings
1. **Analyst A (Best)**: Most rigorous value framework, deepest integration of counter-factors (e.g., form streaks, irrelevant Copa), explicit edges/stakes/risks. Critical without bias; highest improvement potential realized.
2. **Analyst C (Strong)**: Close second—excellent probabilistic rigor and risk summary, correctly prioritizes NO -1.5. Slightly edged out by less polish and forcing a fair-priced rec.
3. **Analyst B (Worst)**: Logical gaps in overhyping Osasuna's attack/margins contradict core data (low gpg, winless run); thin risks and speculative -1.5 YES reduce credibility.

### Key Disagreements
- **Osasuna Win**: A fades (overpriced at 52-54% true vs. 56%); B bullish value (65%); C fair/slight value (57%).
- **Osasuna -1.5**: A/C strong value on NO (82-85%/78% true); B speculative YES value—major divide, as A's/C's logic better matches Osasuna's scoring anemia.
- **BTTS/Over 2.5**: Consensus YES value (all ~3-8% edges), though B least quantified.
- **Draw**: Only A flags as speculative value; others ignore.

### Missing Considerations
- **Liquidity Risks in Depth**: B/C note bid/ask spreads, but none quantify impact on EV (e.g., effective price slippage on fills) or advise limit orders.
- **Osasuna Suspension Risk**: Boyomo's 4 yellows "at risk" unmentioned—could weaken defense in a key home game.
- **Recent Form Granularity**: Levante's 0-2 loss was away (relevant); Osasuna's 2-2 home draw suggests overs/BTTS but tight margins—all underplay this.
- **Market Movement**: No pre-match line shift analysis (e.g., how odds evolved); assumes static Kalshi prices.
- **External Factors**: No weather/stadium (El Sadar is high-altitude, windy—could favor home/low scores) or referee data, though absent from research.
